      <h2>Discoveries</h2>
      <p>EAB was first discovered in North America near Detroit, Michigan in 2002, and has been found in numerous other states, as well as Canada, since then. It was discovered in Iowa in 2010 on in island in the Mississippi River near the town of New Albin.</p>
      <h2>Firewood</h2>
      <p>The spread of EAB into uninfected areas has been done primarily through the movement of firewood. Iowa is currently under federal firewood transport quarantine, which means that, although it is not illegal to transport firewood within the state or into other quarantined states, it is strongly recommended that firewood only be obtained from within the county where it will be burned. Additional states under quarantine include Colorado, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Transport of firewood from a quarantined state to a non-quarantined state is illegal per USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services protocol.</p>
      <h2>What is The Emerald Ash Borer</h2>
      <p>It's an exotic insect pest from Asia. The flattened, creamy white larval stage feeds below the bark and cuts off the living, water and nutrient conducting vessels causing tree death. Adults are small elongated oval beetles that are metallic green in color. This insect colonizes the top of ash trees.</p>
